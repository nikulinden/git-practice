git commit
    --amend # redo the previous commit if you need to update it. If want to add more

git branch
git branch <branch-name>        # create a branch
git switch <branch-name>        # switch between the branches
git switch -c <branch-name>     # create and switch oneliner

git checkout -b <branch-name>   # create and switch; also cmd does a lot more

git branch -d <branch-name>     # delete branch
git branch -D <branch-name>     # forcefully delete a branch
git branch -m <new-brand-name>  # rename branch name; has to switch to the branch you want to rename first

========================================================
merging branches and resolving conflicts
========================================================
# fast forward merge - when nothing else was changed on main and the head is just catching up

# 1. switch to the branch merging to, e.g. main branch
# 2. mege the branch to main branch

git switch main
git merge bugfix


# merge commit - when the branches diverged but not in conflicts
# same steps as fast forward merge


# merge conflicts
# 1. Open up the files with merge conflicts
# 2. Edit the files to remove the conflics. Decide which branch's content you want to keep in each conflict. Or keep both
# 3. Remove the conflict markers
# 4. Add changes and make a commit

=============================================
# git diff
=============================================

git diff                    # shows commits that are not staged
git diff HEAD               # shows changes since last commit
git diff HEAD HEAD~1
git diff --staged
git diff --cached           # both cmds show staged diff

# by adding file or files name at the end, one can diff for specific files

git diff branch1..branch2   # compare branches
git diff commit1..commit2   # compare commits - insert hashes

---------------------------------------------
find . -name '.DS_Store' -delete
find . -name '.DS_Store' -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --cached
git rm --cached `find . -name ".DS_Store"`
git commit -m "Remove .DS_Store files"

echo '.DS_Store' >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .DS_Store to .gitignore"
----------------------------------------------

====================================================
git stash

====================================================

git stash               # stash unstaged changes
git stash pop           # apply and pop the stashed changes
git stash apply         # apply stashed changes but do not remove them from the stash stack

git stash list          # list the existing changes that are stashed on the stack
git stash apply stash@{2}   # apply specific stash

git stash drop stash@{2}    # drop specific stash
git stash clear             # clear all stashes

=====================================================================
git checkout <commit-hash>                     # time travel, detached HEAD
# potentially branch off normally
git switch main                                # switch back to main, re-attach HEAD

git checkout HEAD~1                            # reference a commit 1 prior to HEAD. 1 can be N
git switch -                                   # go back to prev branch

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# discard changes

git checkout HEAD <filename - optional>          # discards unstaged changes
# same as 
git checkout -- <filename - optional>

# new command 'restore'
git restore <filename - optional>               # same as above
git restore --source HEAD~1 <filename>          # revert to an N commit but no time travel
git restore <filename>                          # revert the above change

git restore --staged <filename>                 # remove a file from staged 

git reset <commit hash>                         # reset to a specific commit but keep changes. Potentially move them to a diff branch

git reset --hard <commit hash> or HEAD~N        # reset commit and changes

git revert <commit hash>                        # similar but instead creates a new commit with the reverted changes


======================================================
# git push <remote> <branch>
git push origin main

# git push <remote> <local-branch>:<remote-branch> - point local branch to a different remote branch - uncommon
git push origin pancake:main 


======================================================
# switch to a remote branch that is not local yet. Main is tracked by origin/main automatically
git switch <branch-name>

git fetch                       # fetch from remote but not in the workspace but origin/main e.g.
git fetch remote origin

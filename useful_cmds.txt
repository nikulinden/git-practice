git branch
git branch <branch-name>        # create a branch
git switch <branch-name>        # switch between the branches
git switch -c <branch-name>     # create and switch oneliner

git checkout -b <branch-name>   # create and switch; also cmd does a lot more

git branch -d <branch-name>     # delete branch
git branch -D <branch-name>     # forcefully delete a branch
git branch -m <new-brand-name>  # rename branch name; has to switch to the branch you want to rename first 

git branch -v                   # more verbose
========================================================
merging branches and resolving conflicts
========================================================
# fast forward merge - when nothing else was changed on main and the head is just catching up

# 1. switch to the branch merging to, e.g. main branch
# 2. mege the branch to main branch

git switch main
git merge bugfix


# merge commit - when the branches diverged but not in conflicts
# same steps as fast forward merge


# merge conflicts
# 1. open up the files with merge conflicts
# 2. Edit the files to remove the conflics. Decide which branch's content you want to keep in each conflict. Or keep both
# 3. Remove the conflict markers
# 4. Add changes aand make a commit
